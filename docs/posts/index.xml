      <description>Goal: extract text and refs from pdfs    I want to extact text and references from pdfs of scientific papers.
In an ideal world, this would include an OCR ability for older papers, but for now, let&amp;rsquo;s just consider modern ones that are already text.
What&amp;rsquo;s out there?    grobid

      <title>Docker R M1</title>

      <description>Docker, R, M1, etc.    My goal is to build a minimal docker image on which I can auto-grade student homework. My previous arrangement used a very shoddy sandbox, and I wanted the security and reliability of a pre-built image.
My requirements for this image are that it can run a reasonably modern version of R, including some tidyverse packages, lme4, rstan, and a few other libraries.
One complication is that I am using an M1 macbook, and I will eventually want this image to run on an x86 server.</description>

      <description>Hugo?    In which I try to set up github pages using Hugo.
 Following instructions from github pages startup up to step 3 Instructions from hugo, although replacing step 3 with the alternate instructions from the geekdoc theme Edited ./config.toml to include the line publishDir = &amp;quot;docs&amp;quot; hugo -D push to github and we are live.  Wrong turns:    Automatic build on commit     Considered, but discarded the idea here, might revisit later to eliminate the hugo building step before pushing to master.</description>
